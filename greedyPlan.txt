1) Find a way to access contents of wikipedia page 
    - All the texts, thats what we use sentence transformers format
    - Are we comparing based on titles or entire wikipedia content?
    - Do we want to include the "hidden links" or not?

2) We use the cosine similarities to compare to compare how similar two links
    - Currently, we already have a way to get all the links
    - This is using Semantic Search I believe, and we input it as a parameter for one function
    - Six links of hypthesis? maybe the max

3) We are using weights of the cosine,
    - Make sure it does not do a loop - revisit pages - we can do this with a hashset
    - We also are looking for the shortest path to get from one place to another
    - Adjust the cosine similarity valyes

    How to make greedy algorithms (comes from... https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/greedy-algorithm)
    - Apply Dijkstra. Consider the 1 - cosine
    - Step 1: In a given problem, find the best substructure or subproblem.
    - Step 2: Determine what the solution will include (e.g., largest sum, shortest path).
    - Step 3: Create an iterative process for going over all subproblems and creating an optimum solution.
